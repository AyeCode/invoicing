= Origin =

Work on Invoicing started in April 2016.
We are proud the original base of the plugin was a fork of [EDD](https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-digital-downloads/) with permission from Pippin.
Additionally we are proud some code from [Sliced Invoices](https://wordpress.org/plugins/sliced-invoices/) by David Grant was used in places, mostly for his beautiful invoice layout.
We worked on the plugin for over a year before it got its first public release, we stripped down the code to make it a simple lightweight payment and invoicing plugin with many additional features to fit the needs of our customers.
